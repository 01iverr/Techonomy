# Techonomy
A website for an e-shop, made as a university assignment for the lesson "Technologies and Programming of Web Applications" at AUEB.

## Description

### 1st Assignment

The goal was to create a website using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.

The website was meant to include only static content, without requiring communication with a Web Server in order to perform functions, or dynamically generate web pages.

The assignment consisted of 5 parts, each one advancing the previous ones, and we were asked to deliver each one separately (hence the different folders), which resulted in many re-writes, as each part had to be copied full before making the next.

## How to navigate

Open the index file in the root directory, in order to access the different parts.

## Prefer:

Prefer to open the index file in part 5 to see the completed website. You can see the signup page clicking on the person icon up right (in part 5 only).
To see the pages of the tv product or laptop go from the menu up left to Televisions category and press more info to the first product (same for the laptop). Tap on "more info" on the first product of each category page to view individual product page.
