# Techonomy
A website for an eshop, made as a university assignment for the lesson "Technologies and Programmming of Web Applications" at AUEB.

## Description

### 1st Assignment

The goal was to create a website using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.

The website was meant to include only static content, without requiring communication with a Web Server in order to perform functions, or dynamically generate web pages.

The assignment consisted of 5 parts, each one advancing the previous ones, and we were asked to deliver each one separately (hence the different folders), which resulted in many re-writes, as each part had to be copied full before making the next.

## How to navigate

Open the index file in the root directory, in order to access the diffenrent parts.
